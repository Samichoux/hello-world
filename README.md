# hello-world
Just an example for learning.

Hi there, 

My name is Sam I'm 19 and I just created my account and to be honest
I wont be the one creating crazy codes for now since I am in the "learning area"

From now I've learn that GitHub is sort of a code hosting platform,
As a user you can create repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.
What I found to be cool is that you get to work together on any project!
I think everyone knows something that someone doesn't.
The others can contribute to your work or mistakes but so can you? 

Cheers :)
